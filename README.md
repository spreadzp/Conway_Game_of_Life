# About game's rules

The Game of Life is a simulation of cellular automotons, evolution of the simulation is determined by the initial "seed".

The rules that drive the simulation are as follows:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
